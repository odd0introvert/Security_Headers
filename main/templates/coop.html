            <p>This response header (also named COOP) allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents. COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can’t access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks (source Mozilla MDN).</p>

            <p><span class="text-indigo-500" >same-origin-allow-popups</span> → Retains references to newly opened windows or tabs which either don’t set COOP or which opt out of isolation by setting a COOP of unsafe-none.</p><br>

Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat.
